# Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE) / Reimagining Census Academy

The U.S. Census Bureau is home to a wide and diverse array of products and services that empower the American people by providing quality, timely data on the most relevant issues of the day. Yet, many individuals do not know where or how to access these data themselves, or how they might generate insight from them. Census Academy addresses this problem by providing educational resources on the kinds of data available and how to access them, and promotes helpful tools that leverage U.S. Census Bureau data. Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE)/Reimagining Census Academy hopes to expand on the great work already being done at the U.S. Census Bureau by providing a low-cost, flexible, built-with-modern-tooling platform that allows for more engaging educational and digital experiences.
